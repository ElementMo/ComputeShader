Description:
Introduces the concept of a compute shader, which can take in arbitrary data, 
operate on it in parallel, then return some data. In this example, the compute 
shader exists mostly as a pass-through shader, but it also modifies the position 
of each vertex by a factor of 1.001, slowly growing the square. The compute 
shader uses a Shader Storage Buffer Object (SSBO) which it can read from and write to.

WARNING: Requires OpenGL version 4.3 or later for the compute shader to compile.

in vec4 color;	// Take in a vec4 for color

{
	out_color = color; // Set our out_color equal to our in color, basically making this a pass-through shader.
